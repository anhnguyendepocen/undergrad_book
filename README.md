includes three variations on a theme.  The basic model with identical workers, then on the job search is added.  Finally, the reading adds
worker types and incomplete information.  Covers all the basic aspects of game theory - sequential games, incomplete and imperfect information
along with a discussion of the empirical work that motivates some of the theory.
