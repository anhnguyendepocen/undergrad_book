The Price of Anarchy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This short piece is an attempt to explain a theorem from computer science
 which provides a lower bound on the performance of unregulated networks.
 You can read about this concept in wikipedia (just type in the title into
 google to get the link).
 The basic idea (at least as I'll describe it here) is to compare Nash equilibri
um with regulation in a matrix game.
 This is a useful exercise because it forces you to work you way through
 all the properties of a matrix game.
 We will also come back to this idea when we study directed search a little
 later in the course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The very simple version we study here describes a network in which websites
 are trying to send 'packets' through a network of routers to a final user.
 Routers are just computers, as are websites.
 We are interested in how many packets the websites are able to transmit
 to the final user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The websites face two problems.
 First, the routers inevitably drop packets, so some information may not
 get through.
 Routers differ in their ability to process packets - some transmit more
 information than others under all traffic conditions.
 Secondly, if too many packets travel through the same router, congestion
 will slow things down.
 If you don't like computers and computer networks, then you can think of
 traffic networks.
 Cars try to get to destinations using different routes.
 Some routes are longer than others, but if all cars try to take the same
 route there will be congestion which will slow down even the faster route.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point we are studying simple matrix games, so we are going to model
 this is a very special way.
 Here is the game:

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind this game is that Router 1 is more efficient.
 We are just going to assume that if a website sends a packet through Router
 1, and there is no congestion, then the packet gets through for sure.
 If a website sends a packet through router 2, then the packet might be
 dropped even if there is no congestion.
 In particular, we will just assume that if there is no congestion, then
 the packet gets through with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1>\beta>0$
\end_inset

.
 The fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 represents the relative inefficiency of Router 2.
 This is just a simple way to approximate efficiency in networks.
 In a real computer network, Router 2 might just be slower, or further from
 the final destination in the sense that there are more 'hops' to other
 routers between Router 2 and the final destination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If two packets end up at the same router at the same time, then there is
 a congestion problem.
 To capture this, we just assume that the router randomly drops one of the
 two packets.
 So if both packets go to router 1, each will get through to its final destinati
on with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If both websites send their packet to router 2, then the router will randomly
 select one of them and try to transmit it - except it will only succeed
 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 So each website will get its packet to the final destination with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

 in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will notice that in this simple matrix game, there are no dominated
 strategies if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\ge\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, Website 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 strictly prefers to use Router 1 if Website 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is using Router 2 and conversely.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, then both Websites will use Router 1, which can be deduced by using iterated
 elimination of dominated strategies.
 What that means is that when both Websites are using Router 1, each gets
 their packet through with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is better than unilaterally deviating and using Router 2, where a
 packet gets through with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reasoning the same way, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, there are a pair of pure strategy equilibrium in which Website 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 uses Router 1 while Website 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 uses Router 2, or the converse.
 We'll come back to the pure strategy equilibria later when we discuss the
 price of anarchy, but observe that there is a sense in which the pure strategy
 equilibrium are a little implausible.
 It seems unlikely in a large computer network than individual websites
 would be able to coordinate their packet sending strategies quite so precisely
 - there are millions of websites that would have to communicate to accomplish
 this kind of coordination.
 A more plausible story is that each website uses a 'mixed strategy' that
 sends some proportion of their packets to each of the different routers.
 We can capture this kind of logic by describing the mixed strategy equilibrium
 of this simple matrix game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discussed in class, we can find this 'mixed' equilibrium by find a
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 with which Website 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 sends its packet through Router 1 which has the property that Website A
 will be indifferent between which of the two routers it uses.
 If we do this, then we might reasonably expect Website A to use a random
 strategy about where to send its packet and we could pick this random strategy
 so that Website B was indifferent.
 This would give us a mixed Nash equilibrium for the little matrix game
 we described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make Website A indifferent, Website B needs to send its packet to Router
 1 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 that satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\pi}{2}+\left(1-\pi\right)=\pi\beta+\left(1-\pi\right)\frac{\beta}{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\frac{2-\beta}{\beta+1}$
\end_inset

 (so 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\pi=\frac{2\beta-1}{\beta+1}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is something you should notice about this solution, which is that
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is larger than 1, which doesn't make any sense.
 This is the kind of signal you should check for when you are doing your
 calculations.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 larger than 1 is telling you that using Router 2 is a dominated strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know what the Nash equilibrium is, we can compute how well the
 network functions.
 To compute the expected number of packets that get through the network
 we just evaluate
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi^{2}+2\left(1-\pi\right)\pi\left(1+\beta\right)+\left(1-\pi\right)^{2}\beta
\]

\end_inset

at the Nash equilibrium value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\frac{2-\beta}{\beta+1}$
\end_inset

.
 According to wxMaxima, this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\left\{ \frac{\left(2\beta-1\right)^{2}}{\beta+1}+\frac{\left(\beta-2\right)^{2}}{\beta+1}-2\left(\beta-2\right)\left(2\beta-1\right)\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

Here is a picture of this function for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 (also drawn with wxMaxima).

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, remember that Router 2 becomes a dominated strategy for both Websites.
 In that case, they both use Router 1 in the unique Nash equilibrium - which
 randomly selects one of their packets and gets it through for sure - i.e.,
 the expected number of packets that gets through is exactly 1 as it appears
 in the picture.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 gets larger, Router 2 is becoming more efficient, so more packets get through
 on average.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 reaches 1, then the routers are equally efficient and both Websites choose
 each of them with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 - the network achieves its best outcome with mixed strategies - 1.5 packets
 get through on average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the case in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, this mixed equilibrium gives the worst possible performance for the network.
 If the network were regulated by someone whose objective is to maximize
 the number of packets that get through, then by instructing the Websites
 to use different routers (for sure), this regulator could ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $1+\beta$
\end_inset

 packets get through.
 The picture that follows illustrates the worst that can happen then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename perfect_coordination.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The red function at the top gives the expected number of packets that are
 transmitted in a fully regulated network, the blue curve below it gives
 the expected number of packets that are transmitted in a Nash equilibrium,
 both as function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the efficiency of Router 2.
 Notice that the difference isn't too big - the fully regulated network
 never achieves more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{4}{3}$
\end_inset

 what the unregulated network does.
 Anarchy simply can't be that costly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to read about how well anarchy does in more realistic (but obviously
 much more complex networks), try the paper 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Selfish Routing and the Price of Anarchy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Tim Roughgarden (Stanford).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned above, this is a little generous toward the regulator, since
 we assume he can individually direct where the website should send their
 packets.
 A more realistic approach in a large network would be to allow the regulator
 to send a message to both websites telling them the probability with which
 they should use Router 1 - the constraint being that we require the regulator
 to give each website the same recommendation.
 Assuming you could force them to carry out that recommendation, the average
 number of packets that the regulator could get through the network is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi^{2}+2\left(1-\pi\right)\pi\left(1+\beta\right)+\left(1-\pi\right)^{2}\beta
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is the common recommendation.
 The best recommendation is the one that maximizes this expression, and
 we can find it by differentiating and setting the result to zero - i.e by
 solving
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2\pi+2\left(1-\pi\right)\left(1+\beta\right)-2\pi\left(1+\beta\right)-2\left(1-\pi\right)\beta=0
\]

\end_inset

The solution (wxMaxima) is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi=\frac{1}{\beta+1}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice a couple of things.
 First, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 goes to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 (the routers are equally efficient), then the regulator who is constrained
 to have both websites use the same strategy will have them choose router
 1 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 That is intuitive - the regulator would rather send the websites through
 different routers, but he can't do that because he is constrained to have
 them use the same strategy.
 If they are equally efficient then he is indifferent about which of the
 two they use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the more surprising thing is what happens when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In that event router 2 is dominated and the websites start to focus on
 Router 1 in the Nash equilibrium.
 The regulator, however, wants them to use router 1 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The average number of packets that get through as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is shown in the following picture:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename symmetric.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now notice that when the regulator tells the websites to use router 1 with
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

, he actually manages to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{7}{6}$
\end_inset

 packets through the network, instead of the single packet that gets through
 in the Nash equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: Now do your own calculation for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Draw a graph showing the average number of packets that the regulator gets
 through the network for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and compare this with what happens in the symmetric Nash equilibrium.
 Might be a good time for you to try to figure out how to use a computer
 algebra package - this is the kind of computation you will often find yourself
 faced with.
