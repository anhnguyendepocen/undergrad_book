One application of auctions which has become increasingly important over
 the last few years is their application to online advertizing.

 These auctions are typically referred to as

Position Auctions.

The technology behind these is remarkable.
 When a search word is entered, a page is returned with a set of search
 results (sometimes referred to as 'organic links') along with a series
 of sponsored links.
 The primary difference between the two is that the sponsored links almost
 always offer to sell you something.
 The organic links may or may not involve sales.
 The sponsored links are useful provided they contain items the person looking
 at the page is likely to want to buy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way the urls are made relevant is to associate with each search term,
 a set of 
\emph on
positions.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is even more sophisticated than this since Google has quite a bit of
 information about the viewer who has entered the search term.
 When the viewer sends his search request to Google, his browser passes
 a cookie to the google server.
 The cookie doesn't identify the viewer directly, but it provides an id
 that can be used to view a database that contains information about past
 searches that have been made from the same browser.
 By viewing these, Google can make a good guess about whether the viewer
 is male or female, rich or poor, young or old, etc.
 The ip adress of the browser can be used to determine where the viewer
 is located geographically.
 Finally, Google knows how likely it is that the viewer using the current
 browser will actually follow a sponsored link.
 Bids that advertizers submit can be conditioned on all these things.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\emph default
The first position is the place at the top right of the page where the first
 sponsored link will be placed, the second position is the second highest
 link that will be displayed, and so on.
 Advertizers who are interested in a particular search term can then bid
 for that position in an auction.
 When you enter your search term, google checks for bids associated with
 that search term, then puts the link associated with the advertizer who
 submitted the highest bid in the first position
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This isn't quite correct.
 In fact what they do is to give each advertizer a score based on how much
 revenue they expect to earn from that advertizer given the bid they have
 submitted.
 The winner of the auction is the advertizer whose bid generates the highest
 expected revenue given his score.
 We use the simpler high bid auction to make things a bit simpler below.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the second highest bidder in the second highest position, etc, before
 sending the page back to you.
 In other words, every Google page view results in a new auction being held.
 In this way, we are all involved in a large number of auctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The payment that a bidder makes depends on the number of viewers who actually
 click on the ad.
 To give some idea of what is involved, Google estimates that bidders who
 wan't to have their link displayed in the third position of the auction
 associated with the search phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

luxury hotels in London
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would have to pay about $3.04 per click.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the enormous number of times Google and Yahoo are used to conduct
 internet searches each day, even a tiny probability of clicking on a sponsored
 ad will result in large revenues for the search sites.
 Tweaking the design of the auction by modifying reserve prices and limiting
 search slots could make a lot of difference to total revenue.
 Squeezing revenue is not the only consideration that is important of course.
 The search engines also want to attract bidders and viewers who will click
 on their ads.
 We deal with some of these issues later in the chapter on competition among
 auctions.
 This chapter focuses on the case where the search site faces an exogenous
 set of advertizers bidding for positions whose value to them is also exogenous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Complete Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, we will simply assume that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 positions which have associated with them exogenously given values 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}>x_{2}>\cdots>x_{K}>0$
\end_inset

.
 The idea is that the slot in the first position is the one that consumers
 are most likely to click.
 There are two reasons for this.
 The first is simply that it is closest to the cursor which has just clicked
 the search box in the top right corner of the browser.
 A more compelling argument is a sort of self fullfilling prophecy that
 we will explain in more detail later.
 If consumers think that the most useful ads are in the first position,
 then firms will bid more aggressively for that position.
 However, the firms that are most likely to win the auction for that position
 are the ones who are most likely to make a sale.
 So at least when consumers want to buy, their expectation that the firms
 from whom they are most likely to buy will be in the first position are
 going to be correct.
 Interpret the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 as the expected number of clicks at position 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 
\begin_inset Formula $m>K$
\end_inset

 firms bidding for the various positions on the web page.
 Firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 that describes its profit per click.
 For simplicity, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}\ge v_{2}\ge\ldots\ge v_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 The expected revenue of a firm who successfully places their ad in position
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Every firm wants the first position, but not all firms will be willing
 to pay the same amount for it.
 All firms, on the other hand, still earn profits by placing their ads in
 lower positions on the web page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position auction works as follows: each firm places a bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The first position is awarded to the bidder who submits the highest bid.
 He then pays the second highest bid for each click.
 Similarly, the bidder with the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 highest bid wins the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 position, and then pays the 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1^{st}$
\end_inset

 highest bid for each click he receives.
 Let the bids be ordered from highest to lowest.
 If firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 wins the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 position (with a bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 in this notation), then his revenue per click is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{i}-b_{j+1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the firm that wins the 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{th}$
\end_inset

 position pays the highest bid of bidders who did not win a slot.
 Given some array 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1},\ldots,b_{m}$
\end_inset

 of bids, bidder 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's total payoff when he wins the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 slot is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(v_{i}-b_{j+1}\right)x_{j},\]

\end_inset

 while his payoff is zero if he doesn't win a slot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for any problem in which we want to use Nash equilibrium to predict the
 outcome, we need to specify the entire game.
 In other words, we have to describe the payoff a player earns for any array
 of bids, and for any bid that he might submit instead.
 This is a little complex here because of the way we are shifting indices,
 and because we have to figure out what will happen when there are ties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the strategies of the players are just their bids.
 Suppose that the player whose name is 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 submits a bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{i}$
\end_inset

, so that the array of bids submitted by all the players is 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\left\{ b^{1},\ldots,b^{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Since the indices only indicate the bidders name, this doesn't say anything
 about order of the bids.
 So lets write 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}\left(b\right)$
\end_inset

 to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 highest bid in the array of bids 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 which is less than or equal to the number of bids in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}\left(b\right)$
\end_inset

 is the highest bid submitted by any player.
 Also note that if 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is one of the bidders, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-i}$
\end_inset

 is the array of bids sumitted by the players other than 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}\left(b^{-i}\right)$
\end_inset

 represents the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 highest bid of the bidders 
\emph on
other 
\emph default
than bidder 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can write the payoff to each player for every array of bids:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\pi^{i}\left(b^{\prime},b^{-i}\right)=\begin{cases}
\left(v_{i}-b_{j+1}\left(b^{-i}\right)\right)x_{j+1} & \exists j<K:b_{j}\left(b^{-i}\right)>b^{\prime}\ge b_{j+1}\left(b^{-i}\right)\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}\label{profit-function}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a complicated expression, so well go over it.
 When a bidder considers a bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, she first checks the bids of the other players (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-i}$
\end_inset

) and puts them in order 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{1}\left(b^{-i}\right),\ldots,b_{m}\left(b^{-i}\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 She then looks to see if her bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is higher than one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 highest bids that the others have submitted.
 For example, if there are four bidders (as there will be in the graphical
 illustration below), and they submit the bids 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 2,4,3,6\right\} $
\end_inset

 (where 2 is submitted by the bidder with identity 1, 4 by bidder with identity
 2, etc, then bidder 3 first takes the other bids 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} $
\end_inset

 and puts them in descending order.
 This gives her the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}\left(\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} \right)=6$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}\left(\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} \right)=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{3}\left(\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} \right)=2$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose there are K=3 positions to be won in the auction.
 She sees that there is a value for 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 , i.e., 2, which is less than the number of positions up for auction, ie,
 3, and such that her bid is still at least as large as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{3}\left(\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} \right)=2$
\end_inset

 .
 That means she will win a slot with this bid, that is slot 
\begin_inset Formula $j+1$
\end_inset

 or 3, and pay 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{3}\left(\left\{ 2,4,6\right\} \right)=2$
\end_inset

 for it.
 Her profit is then the difference between her value and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 multiplied by the average number of clicks associated with slot 3.
 The math expression above is certainly a more consise way of saying this.
 It even works when there are more bidders than slots once you think it
 through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you might have noticed in this discussion that the equation takes a
 bit of a shortcut.
 Notice the inequality sign before 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j+1}\left(b^{-i}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 What that means is that bidder 3 believes that if she matches the bid 2
 that was submitted by bidder 1 exactly, she will still win the final slot,
 even though bidder 1 has the same bid.
 Then if you try to do the same calculation for bidder 1 (the one who bid
 2) you will find that he also expects to win the slot in this situation.
 That can't really be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that this is a reasonable assumption is that bidder 3 could ensure
 this were true by submitting a bid ever so slightly higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 She would then win the third slot for sure and makes almost the same profit
 that we have given her here.
 What this means is that if we can find a Nash equilibrium with this payoff
 function and there are no ties in this equilibrium, then the equilibrium
 will continue to be an equilibrium if we come up with some more realistic
 tie breaking rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have the profit function (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "profit-function"

\end_inset

), we basically know the payoffs that each player will get for every array
 of bids.
 That is like knowing what payoffs we put in each cell of the matrix in
 a bimatrix game.
 A Nash equilibrium of this game is an array of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bids such that no player can improve his payoff given the bids of the other
 players.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can't really do the gambit thing and check every profile of bids for
 profitable deviations.
 There is a continuum of profiles to worry about.
 Solving games like this usually means making a good guess about what the
 equilibrium looks like, then trying to verify your guess is an equilibrium.
 The educated guess here comes from the observation that if you win a slot
 at all, you won't pay what you bid.
 Instead, you'll pay what one of the other players bid.
 So your only real choice is to decide which slot, if any, you want.
 The others' bids complete determine what you pay when you win it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of the guess comes from the intution that it is likely to
 be the case that the bidder with the highest value will want the best slot,
 the bidder with the second highest value will want the second best slot,
 and so on.
 Why? Well, at this stage in your reasoning you can't really articulate
 why, but is just seems right.
 Nash equilibrium is going to give us a conceptual tool that will make it
 crystal clear why that intution will work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WIth that start, lets just guess that each slot with have a price, say 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\ge p_{2}\ldots\ge p_{K}$
\end_inset

, and that the bidder with the highest value will have to win the best slot,
 and so on as we described above.
 Since bidders are really only choosing which slot to win, this will only
 work if the set of prices satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v_{i}-p_{i}\ge0\label{non-negative}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}-p_{K}\le0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i>K$
\end_inset

.
 If this weren't true, then some of the winners would be sorry to have won.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, since players can also win other players slots by outbidding them
 (and they don't have to worry about their actual bid), then for 
\begin_inset Formula $K\ge i\ge1$
\end_inset

, player 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 would prefer to win slot 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, than to win any other slot ,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(v_{i}-p_{i}\right)x_{i}\ge\left(v_{i}-p_{j}\right)x_{j}\label{modular}\end{equation}

\end_inset

for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we could find a solution to these inequalities, then we could just have
 each bidder submit the corresponding bid, i.e., the bidder with the highest
 value could submit the bid 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

, etc.
 No bidder would want outbid any other bidder, because that would violate
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "modular"

\end_inset

).
 Finding a solution to a set of inequalities -- now we are back in algorithm
 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, start with the firm with the 
\begin_inset Formula $K+1^{st}$
\end_inset

 highest value, and suppose that this firm bids its value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{K+1}$
\end_inset

.
 This determines the price of the 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{th}$
\end_inset

 and worst slot to be 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{K+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If firm 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 buys this slot, it earns 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{K}-v_{K+1}\right)x_{k}\ge0$
\end_inset

.
 Now for 
\begin_inset Formula $i<K$
\end_inset

, recursively define
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(v_{i}-p_{i}\right)x_{i}=\left(v_{i}-p_{i+1}\right)x_{i+1}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A diagram will illustrate why this simple construction will generate a set

Recursive Construction of Slot Prices

\end_layout

\end_inset

The horizontal axis in the picture measures the possible values that firms
 can have for slots.
 The values of the top four firms are marked.
 The dashed line with the lowest slope (the blue line in the picture) is
 the graph of the function
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(v-v_{4}\right)x_{3}\]

\end_inset

which describes the payoff to different firm types when they buy slot 3
 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 It is flat becase the slope of the line is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

, the click through rate of the worst available slot.
 The advantage of drawing this is that it makes it possible to see the profits
 the higher valued firms would make from this slot as well.
 Following our construction, we choose the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 for slot 2 that makes the bidder with value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

 just indifferent between purchasing slot 2 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2},$
\end_inset

 and buying slot 3 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 The dashed red line in the picture represents the payoff function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v-p_{2}\right)x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This line is steeper than the line for the third slot because its slope
 is equal to the higher click through rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the click through rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is higher than the click through rate for slot 3, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 is going to have to be higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the payoff function given by the red line is steeper than the one
 associated with the blue line, firm 3 is going to prefer slot 3 to slot
 2 when they are priced this way.
 The green line (the one with the steepest slope) shows how to construct
 the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 for the most valuable slot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now these prices 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the inequalities (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "non-negative"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "modular"

\end_inset

).
 To se why, look at the outcome for the bidder with value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 He is supposed to win slot 3 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

, so the profit he gets from that can be read as the distance up to the
 blue dashed line.
 Similarly he could try the other slots by paying 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

, and you can read the consquences of these choices by measing the distance
 up to the red and green lines - at value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

, up is down to those lines, which means that bidder 3 would lose money
 on these other slots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, bidder 2 is supposed to win slot 2 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 His profit is the distance up to the red line above 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 He could win the lower slot at price 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

, but if he did, he would get the same profit because of the way we chose
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Again, if he tried to win the higher slot, his profit would be negative,
 which you can see by reading from the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the bids, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 will support the slot prices that satisfy (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "non-negative"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "modular"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It isn't hard to understand why the firms do this in this example.
 They never expect to have to pay what they bid, so there is no reason for
 them to worry about their bid, beyond the fact that it secures the slot
 they want.
 Firm 3, for example, knows in this equilibrium that he will only have to
 pay 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

 for the slot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, observe that we can support many Nash equilibria this way.
 All we need to do is to make sure that each of the top three firms makes
 a profit on the slot they win, and that each prefers their slot to any
 other slot.
 In the picture, just slide the red line to the left to any position in
 which firm 3 prefers slot 3 to slot 2 (which just means the blue line has
 to be higher than the red line at 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

).
 Similarly, slide the green line to the left lowering 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 to any position at which the blue line is higher than the green line at
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 These changes will generate new Nash equilibrium with new prices for the
 different slots.
 These prices will be lower for slots 1 and 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, we could go the other way and raise revenues that are
 generated by the position auction.
 We can't just raise bidder 3's bid this time, because if we do, bidder
 2 will switch and want to bid on the worst slot instead of on the second
 best slot.
 We could raise revenues by increasing the bid by bidder 4 however.
 This may be one reason that google doesn't explain exactly how they set
 their prices.
 The Nash equilibrium leaves some money on the table for them if they can
 set the price of the lowest slot to the value of the third highest bidder.

A second price auction of the kind we are studying here often has the feature
 that bidders will bid their 'valuations'.
 This won't necessarily support on equilibrium here as Figure

 illustrates.

In this Figure, each bidder bids his own value, which would give prices
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}$
\end_inset

 for slot 3, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

 for slot 2 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

 for slot 1.
 The it is easy to see from the figure, that at these prices, all three
 of the top bidders would prefer to win the third slot.
 The reason is that the higher prices that are supported by the bidders
 values, aren't warranted given the marginally higher click through rates
 associated with the better slots.
 We have no problem constructing an equilibrium for this problem, however,
 it won't support an outcome where bidders bid their true values.

\begin_layout Section
Consumer Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the fact that firms bid more than a slot is truly worth to them
 in the position auctions, there are a number of characteristics of this
 model that seem unrealistic.
 First, each firm knows exactly what the values of the other firms are.
 This is what allows them to confidently bid way more for a slot than it
 is worth to them.
 Perhaps more important, the click through rates that the firms are bidding
 on are unrelated to the characteristics of the firms that are actually
 making the bids.
 Most consumers will only click on sponsored ads if they feel that these
 ads will provide them useful information.
 Whether they do or not must surely depend on the characteristics they believe
 the bidding firms have.
 Secondly, there is a strong connection between click through rates and
 the position of the ad on the web page.
 Presumably this reflects the fact that consumers think that ads in a higher
 slot are more informative.
 It would be nice to know exactly why this might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we try to incorporate some of these things into the analysis.
 Lets assume first that consumers bear costs when they click on a sponsored
 link.
 There are two reasons this is a reasonable assumption.
 First, consumers interest in following a commercial link differ.
 Some consumers have a direct an immediate need, while others may be viewing
 search results for other reasons.
 A consumer whose primary interest is to locate a fact may find it very
 costly to follow a sponsored link that may or may not lead him to something
 that he can buy.
 Secondly, even consumers with immediate needs may find sponsored links
 costly.
 The link itself probably won't directly provide the price and product informati
on they want, causing them to have to search a specific website while they
 may be able to find the information they want more effectively by searching
 organic links.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the search cost for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 drawn using a uniform distribution on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Lets makes things simple and assume that there are only two consumers like
 this.
 Firms, on the other hand, are distinguished by the probability with which
 they will be able to supply the good the consumers are looking for.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the probability with which firm 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 can supply a consumer.
 Again, we'll assume this is drawn using a uniform distribution on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 We'll also assume that there are 3 firms competing for two slots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumers have value 1 if the link that they click leads a product they
 want.
 The firm at that link also receives revenue 1 in this case.
 So the way the auction works is that consumers open a page with 2 sponsored
 links.
 A consumer has cost 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of clicking a sponsored link and discovering whether or not the good that
 is advertized is one that they want.
 Depending on the cost of clicking on the link, the consumer decides whether
 or not to click.
 If the cost is low enough that the consumer does want to click, we assume
 that she clicks the top link first and explain why it makes sense for her
 to do this in a bit.
 If she decides it isn't worth it to follow the sponsored link, she leaves
 with zero payoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the firm behind the link has quality 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

, then a transaction happens with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 In that event the consumers payoff is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-s_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the firms payoff is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-b_{i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the amount that the firm agreed to pay for its advertizing slot when
 it won it at auction.
 If the transaction doesn't happen, the firm gets nothing from the transaction,
 but still pays 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the click.
 The consumer then decides again based on her cost, whether or not to click
 on the second sponsored link.
 If she doesn't click, then she simply leaves the auction having born the
 search costs associated with her first click.
 If she does decide to continue searching, she meets a firm with whom she
 transacts with whatever probability 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 characterizes that firms quality.
 If no transaction occurs in this case, she leaves the auction site with
 payoff equal to minus twice her search cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model (which is based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "athell08"

\end_inset

is relatively simple, but captures a number of interesting features.
 First, the value of the different slot positions to firms is endogenous
 since the click through rate will depend on how many consumers have search
 costs low enough to induce them to follow the link.
 The identity of these consumers is also enogenous since whether or not
 they want to follow a link will depend on how likely it is the link will
 provide them a transaction.
 If the firms who are most likely to be able to supply consumers (that is,
 firms with high 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

) think that consumers are clicking the top ad first, then they will be
 willing to bid more for the first slot.
 If they do, then consumers will be quite rational in thinking that they
 are more likely to find a transaction if they click the first link than
 if they click the second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model also resolves one of the issues associated with the position
 auction we discussed in the first part of this chapter, since firms won't
 know exactly the values of their competitors.
 This helps make bidding strategies of the firms more reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, we assume the firms submit bids to the position auction.
 He highest bidder is awarded the top slot on the page, and required to
 pay the bid of the second highest bidder.
 Similarly, the second highest bidder is given the second slot and required
 to pay the bid of the third highest bidder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see how the equilibrium unfolds, lets suppose for the moment, that each
 firm uses the same bidding strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(q\right)$
\end_inset

 that is monotonically increasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 If the realized qualities of the three firms are 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}>q_{2}>q_{3}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}>b_{2}>b_{3}$
\end_inset

 and firm 1 will win the first slot on the page, while firm 3 won't win
 any slot at all.
 From consumers' perpective, the expected quality of the firm whose advertizemen
t appears in the first slot is the expected value of the highest of the
 three qualities of firms who are bidding, while the expected quality of
 the firm in the second slot is the expectation of the second highest quality.
 As these qualities are uniformly distributed, it isn't so hard to figure
 out what these are.
 For example, there are three firms who qualify as candidates for the highest
 quality firm.
 Each quality in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 is equally likely.
 For any particular quality 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and firm, the probability that the other two firms have lower qualities
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So the expected value of the highest quality firm is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}q\left(3q^{2}\right)dq=\frac{3}{4}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, the expected quality of the firm who wins the second slot can
 be calculated from the following observation: if this firm has quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, then the probability that one of the others has lower quality, while the
 other has higher quality is 
\begin_inset Formula $q\left(1-q\right)$
\end_inset

.
 There other two can be ordered in two different ways, and there are three
 different firms who could have the second highest quality.
 So the expected quality of the firm in the second slot is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int q6q\left(1-q\right)dq=\frac{1}{2}.\]

\end_inset

This begins to explain why it makes sense for consumers to click on the
 top ad, since the probability with which they will find what they are looking
 for if they click there is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

, while if they click on the second ad it is only 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So we will assume from now on that consumers whose search costs are low
 enough that they will want to click on some ad, will choose the top url
 first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their search problem doesn't end at this point, because there is still a
 ex ante probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

 that they won't find what they want after clicking on the first ad.
 The first ad represents their best chance of finding a useful product.
 So if they don't find what they want, then it is bad news, and they should
 revise their estimate of the expected quality of the firm at the second
 position downward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this, we need to calculate the probability that the consumer will
 trade if he clicks on the second link conditional on failing to trade after
 clicking on the first link.
 The easiest way to do this computation is directly using the distribution
 of the second order statistic of firm qualities.
 If the firm with the second highest quality has quality 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, then the expected quality of the firm with the highest quality is 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\frac{1-x}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Conditional on the second best firm's quality, the probability that the
 consumer trades with the second best firm and fails with the first is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(1-x-\frac{1-x}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Integrating this across the possible qualities of the second best firm
 using the density of the second best firm's quality that we derived above,
 then dividing by the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

 with which the consumer fails to trade with the best firm (since we want
 the trading probability conditional on failure on the first try), we derive
 the probability with which the consumer trades with the second best firm
 after failing to find what she want with the first to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{5}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that this is much lower than the expected quality of the second
 best firm at the beginning of the search process.
 Once again, this is because the failure to trade with the first firm suggests
 that the best firm has a relatively low quality.
 This makes the consumer more pessimistic about the quality of the firm
 available at the second link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we know exactly how the consumer is going to conduct her search.
 She perceives a cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of clicking on any link, so she simply compares the expected quality available
 by clicking on the link with her cost.
 Consumers whose costs exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

 won't bother to click on the sponored links at all.
 If their costs are below 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

, they will click on the first sponsored link on the page.
 Some consumers who do this will find just what they want, and will leave
 the search process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who fail to find what they want after the first link, become much
 more pessimistic as we explained.
 If their costs are between 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

 they won't bother to click on another sponsored link.
 However, those whose costs are below 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{5}$
\end_inset

 will continue their search and click on the second link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is exactly the information needed to determine how valuable the different
 slots are to firms.
 There are two consumers.
 No matter what the firm bids, two consumers will click on the first slot
 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

 (which is the proability that both consumers have search costs below 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

).
 The probability that only one consumer clicks is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

, while the probability there are no clicks at all is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The revenue that a firm of type 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 gets from slot 1 is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{1}\left(q\right)=\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}2q+2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)q=\frac{6}{4}q.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, a sale through the second slot requires two things to
 occur.
 First, consumers must be unsatisfied at the first link.
 Then, in addition, their search costs have to be low enough to induce them
 to click on the second link.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability that consumers who want to search fail to transact after
 clicking on the first link depends on the quality of the firm who wins
 the first link.
 This characteristic of the position auction makes it unusual.
 What it takes to win the top slot depends on what the firm who wins the
 second slot bids.
 So the 
\emph on
revenue 
\emph default
earned by the firm in the second position depends on its bid.
 Exactly how it depends is determined by the equilibrium bidding rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see how, let 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(q\right)$
\end_inset

 be some monotonic bidding rule that firms are using to submit bids in the
 position auction.
 If a firm bids 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, then it wins the first auction if both of the other firms have qualities
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(q\right)<b^{\prime}.$
\end_inset

 If we write 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 to be the firm type who bids 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, then the probability that the firm wins the first slot with a bid 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It earns 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}\left(q\right)$
\end_inset

 in this event as we explained above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability that it wins the second slot is 
\begin_inset Formula $2b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)\left(1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In this case estimates the expected quality of the firm who won the best
 slot to be 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)+\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{2}.\]

\end_inset

Then the probability that a consumer both has search cost less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{5}$
\end_inset

 and fails to buy from the firm at the first slot is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{5}\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This gives the revenue to a firm when it wins the second slot as
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{2}\left(q,b^{\prime},b\left(\cdot\right)\right)=\left(\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{5}\right)^{2}2q+2\left(\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{5}\right)\left(1-\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{5}\right)q=\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
2q\left(\frac{1-b^{-1}\left(b^{\prime}\right)}{5}\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use all this to work out the equilibrium bidding rule.
 Assuming the bidding rule is monotonic, the expected payoff of a firm of
 type 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 who bids as if her quality were 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(q^{\prime}\right)^{2}\frac{6}{4}q+2q^{\prime}\left(1-q^{\prime}\right)2q\left[\left(\frac{1-q^{\prime}}{5}\right)\right]-b\left(q^{\prime}\right).\]

\end_inset

The equilibrium bidding rule should have the property that a firm of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 actually wants to bid as if its quality were 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 This requires that the derviative of the expression above with respect
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 should be uniformly equal to zero in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 Taking the first derivative in the expression above is a straightforward
 but tedious exercise.
 Since a firm of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 obviously wants to bid 0, this yields a differential equation whose solution
 provides the equilibrium bidding rule.
