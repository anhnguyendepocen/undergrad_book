\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In traditional economics, a public good is usually defined as something
 that everyone enjoys.
 Typical examples might be police service, a bridge, and opera house, and
 so on.
 Typically that simple definition never fits examples.
 Bridges are subject to congestion, police services are services - private
 goods for the most part.
 Builidings are enjoyed for what happens inside them, typically not so much
 for what they are.
 Perhaps a better definition of a public good is one that is produced at
 a possibly high fixed cost, but which can then be distributed at zero marginal
 cost.
 This is what we will mean by a public good in this reading.
 Software is a great example - it is costly to write and debug, but once
 it is there, the use value I get from it isn't affected by whether or not
 you use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the goods that we find most important are like this.
 Once an mp3 file has been recorded, anyone who listens to it is unaffected
 by whether or not other people also listen to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this reading, a 
\emph on
public good
\emph default
 is one having the property that once it has been produced, it can be made
 freely available to everyone.
 An mp3 file, or a computer program would fit into this category.
 Contrast this with the 
\emph on
private goods
\emph default
 we have discussed so far.
 If one person consumes a private good, no other consumer can have that
 good.
 Some of the more important goods in the modern economics are actually public
 in this sense.
 For example, an idea or a bit of information is a public good.
 Whether or not you know the idea, or have the information does not impact
 on my ability to know the same thing or have the same information (though
 whether or not you have the same information as I do may determine whether
 or not I can make money off you).
 A music file shared on my computer is a public good -- if you download
 it from my website, my ability to enjoy it is not affected at all.
 A theorem, like the first welfare theorem that we studied last week, is
 a public good: I do not forget it when you learn it.
 Contrast this with my car or my lunch which are both private goods: if
 you take them from me I cannot enjoy them at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This note describes an equilibrium for the 
\emph on
voluntary contribution game
\emph default
, which is a common way to think about how public goods are provided.
 It explains why the amount of the public good in the voluntary contribution
 game is under produced (because the outcome is not Pareto optimal: there
 is another outcome that will make everyone better off).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The voluntary contribution game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose there are two goods, one public (
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

) and one private (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 denote the amount of the public good that can be produced from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 units of the private good.
 Suppose there are two consumers with utility functions 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Their endowments of the private good are 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The set of points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(x,y\right):y=f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
production possibilities frontier
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the first consumer decides to consume 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 (and devote the rest of his endowment 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 to production of the public good) while consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 decides to consume 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 the utilities of each of the consumers are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{1}\left(x_{1},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}-x_{2}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

 for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{2}\left(x_{2},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}-x_{2}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

 for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 The important point is that if consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, say, decides to consume a bit less of the private good and produce a bit
 more of the public good, then consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 will enjoy the additional public good too without any cost at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The voluntary contribution game equilibrium is one way to predict how much
 of the private good each consumer will choose.
 Each of the consumers simply picks the amount of the private good they
 want on their own.
 This is a bit hard to do because the amount that each consumer will choose
 to contribute depends on how much they expect the other consumer to contribute.
 A good way to do this is to use a 
\emph on
Nash equilibrium
\emph default
 in place of a Walrasian equilibrium.
 Instead of taking prices to be fixed, each consumer takes the contribution
 of the other consumer to be fixed and chooses the contribution that maximizes
 his utility given this expectation.
 In a Walrasian equilibrium, when a consumer acts as if he believes that
 prices are fixed, he has to be physically able to purchase the bundle that
 maximizes his utility at these prices.
 That is why the price expectations have to be such that markets clear.
 Analogously, when the consumer chooses his optimal contribution given a
 fixed expectation about the contribution of the other consumer, he has
 to end up with exactly the amount of the public good that he expected to
 get.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, a Nash equilibrium for the voluntary contribution game is a pair
 of private consumptions 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{1}\left(x_{1}^{\ast},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}^{\ast}-x_{2}^{\ast}\right)\right)\geq u_{1}\left(x^{\prime},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x^{\prime}-x_{2}^{\ast}\right)\right)\label{consumer_1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for any alternative contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime}\in\left[0,\omega_{1}\right]$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{2}\left(x_{2}^{\ast},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}^{\ast}-x_{2}^{\ast}\right)\right)\geq u_{2}\left(x^{\prime},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}^{\ast}-x^{\prime}\right)\right)\label{consumer_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for any alternative contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime}\in\left[0,\omega_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to view the outcome of this game is given in Figure 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 where the two consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

.
 The `budget line' that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 faces, for example, when consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 chooses consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 is the set of all pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(x_{1},y\right):y=f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}-x_{2}^{\ast}\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The slope of this is exactly the same as the slope of the production possibilit
ies frontier at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1}^{\ast}+x_{2}^{\ast},y^{\ast}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The same is true for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 So, in the equilibrium of the voluntary contribution game, each consumer
 has the same marginal rate of substitution and the same marginal rate of
 transformation in production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With private goods, this is exactly what you want.
 Recall that, in the Edgeworth box, both consumers' indifference curves
 were tangent and the common slope of their indifference curves was equal
 to the slope of the production possibilities frontier.
 With public goods, this is not the outcome that you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach -- that helps to explain how contributions are determine
d and why these contributions are not Pareto optimal -- is to try find the
 best choice for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to make for all the different possible contribution levels that consumer
 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 might choose.
 This approach is more common in game theory and involves the construction
 of something called the 
\emph on
best reply function
\emph default
.
 The best reply functions are put together to understand the final outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 2, the various 
\emph on
consumption choices
\emph default
 that player 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 can make are given along the bottom axis.
 Each such choice implies a contribution to the production of the public
 good - just take the difference between the consumption level and the endowment
 to find it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The green lines represent iso-utility curves for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 They are solutions to equations of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{1}\left(x_{1},f\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-x_{1}-x_{2}\right)\right)=K
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is some constant.
 Consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 achieves higher utility (holding his own consumption level constant) the
 
\emph on
lower
\emph default
 is the consumption level of consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 Lower consumption by consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 means that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is contributing more of her endowment to produce the public good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Nash equilibrium, consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 forms some belief about the consumption level that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 will pick.
 Suppose for the moment, that he believes that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 will choose consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Then he can attain any 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 combination that lies on the vertical line through 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 The best such point is the one that lies on the highest iso-utility curve.
 That is the one through the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R_{1}\left[x^{\prime\prime}\right],x^{\prime\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 where an iso-utility curve is just tangent to this vertical line.
 (If he were to lower his planned consumption by moving down this vertical
 line, he would end up on a lower iso-utility curve like the one that lies
 just to the right of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R_{1}\left[x^{\prime\prime}\right],x^{\prime\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There would be a different best choice like this for every different choice
 that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 makes.
 The picture shows the corresponding tangencies at point 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\prime\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 If you joined all these best choices together they would form a line (not
 necessarily straight as it is in the picture) called consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

's reaction function.
 This is the line 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}R_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the picture.
 It explains what consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 would choose to do for every possible different belief that he might have
 about the consumption choice of consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig3.eps
	width 3.2949in
	height 2.412in

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Doing the same exercise for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 yields a similar curve, which is drawn in Figure 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}R_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The point where these two curves intersect is the Nash equilibrium.
 Each consumer chooses his best consumption given what he expects the other
 consumer to choose; and, as it turns out, the other consumer always does
 exactly what he expects him to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you try to construct the iso-utility curves for person 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, he will choose one that is tangent to the flat line through 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 since he expects consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

's consumption choice to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 no matter what he does.
 This means that the iso-utility curves for the two consumers must cut through
 each other as shown in the diagram.
 There must be a point like 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 where both of the consumers would be better off if they could jointly agree
 to move there.
 That would involve each of them reducing their own consumption of the private
 good and using that to increase production of the public good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is wrong with the outcome in the voluntary contribution game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since it is so important to understand how externalities work in economics,
 lets make the argument in a different way.
 This exercise also helps to understand the methods that micro economists
 sometimes use to describe why institutions work badly, and the sorts of
 ideas they propose to fix them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, lets revert to the picture we have used so far to describe allocations
, with the total consumption of the private good on the horizontal axis
 and the output of the putblic good on the vertical axis.
 For the purposes of this argument, lets just imagine that the private good
 is money.
 The public good is any good that can be reproduced at zero marginal cost.
 I'll call it software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical software programs use existing libraries to carry out simple tasks
 that come about during the creation of some higher level process.
 For example, a web page that displays an ad may request the ad from some
 other computer on a network.
 The 'process' of requesting an ad or any bit of infomration over a network
 in the course of building a webpage is patentable.
 The actual code that carries out the request is a software program that
 is subject copyright - two different levels of protection.
 If there is no patent on the process, then the copyright holder can prevent
 someone else from using his or her program to make a network request unless
 they pay a fee.
 If you aren't willing to pay the fee, then you can write your own version
 of the program.
 If the 
\emph on
process 
\emph default
of making a network request is also patented, then you can't actually make
 a network request without paying a fee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Canada and the US, patents have nothing to do with invention, the first
 person to apply for a patent gets it no matter who 'invented', if that
 is the right word, the process.
 In many ways the reason that companies apply for patents is to protect
 themselves from other patent holders.
 If they have a patent 
\emph on
portfolio 
\emph default
then they can make cross licensing agreements with other large companies
 that also have portfolios.
 These agreements mean that the companies agree not to sue each other for
 patent infringement.
 The sort of companies that make these agreements -- Microsoft, Apple, Dell,
 Samsung.
 Of course, this creates an even bigger pool of patents these companies
 can use to sue other entrants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What has saved the tech sector from software patents is open source software
 -- Google, Facebook and the other big social media giants have been developed
 using open source software.
 At least in my experience, they tend to give back by giving their own code
 open source licenses so that other firms can use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the story that follows software means the bundles of library code and
 software methods that users develop to carry out their day to day activities
 over the computer.
 Each of the two consumers below writes software for this purpose.
 The voluntary contribution game approximates the open source method.
 We'll try to compare that with what happens in the patent sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the voluntary contribution story given above, each consumer has a
 payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the amount of their money income they keep for themselves, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 the total amount of software code that they use.
 The software is freely redistributable since an essentially unlimited number
 of copies of the software can be made at no extra cost, so it satisfies
 the definition of a public good as we described it above.
 Indifference curves for consumer 1 are bundles that give him or her the
 same level of utility.
 For consumer 1, this is really straightforward.
 The indifference curve is just the collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 pairs that satisfy
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{1}\left(x,y\right)=K.
\]

\end_inset

The graphs of these curves look no different than they do in any other problem.
 Higher indifference curves (further away from the origin) represent higher
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in the equation above, and correspondingly higher payoffs to consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leap we are going to make here is that when we choose a bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 for consumer 1, this bundle induces a corresponding bundle for consumer
 2 given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-f^{-1}\left(y\right)-x,y\right).
\]

\end_inset

In words, we figure out how much money is required to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, that is the 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{-1}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

, then subtract that from the total endowment 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 to get the total amount of money left over after producing 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 units of software.
 Subtract the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 we want to give to consumer 1, then give the rest to consumer 2.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{-1}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 is sometimes referred to as the cost function for the public good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this logic, we could define an indifference curve for 
\emph on
consumer 2 
\emph default
by finding all the consumption bundles for 
\emph on
consumer 1 
\emph default
that induce the same payoff for player 2.
 Formally, an indifference curve for player 2 is the collection of all bundles
 for player 1 that satisfy
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-f^{-1}\left(y\right)-x,y\right)=K.
\]

\end_inset


\emph on
 
\emph default
To figure out what these indifference curves look like is a bit daunting.
 Holding 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 constant, the less money consumer 1 has, the more is left over for consumer
 2.
 In this sense, player 2's indifference curves represent higher payoffs
 for 2 the closer they are to the origin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the rest, we'll rely on the idea that the public good provides diminishing
 marginal utility to consumer 2.
 What that means is that the more of the public good that is being produced,
 the less valuable an additional unit of the public good will be.
 Fix the consumption of the private good of consumer 1 at some value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 and travel up the vertical line through 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Remember that changing the public good in this case means that all the
 cost of producing the public good is borne by consumer 2 since the amount
 of money consumer 1 has is being held constant at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Initially as you increase the public good, this makes consumer 2 better
 off since the public good is very valuable to her when there isn't much
 of it.
 Eventually the thrill will wear off, and as the production of the public
 good gets higher and higher, consumer 2's payoff will begin to decline.
 What that means is that consumer 2's indifference curves will typically
 cross any vertical line twice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there will be one indifference curve that is just tangent to
 the vertical line.
 This one is illustrated in the picture below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indifference curves should look like backward C's as in the following
 diagram, where I have superimposed consumer 2's indifference curve into
 the original diagram depicting the Nash equilibrium of the voluntary contributi
on game.
 Let me explain why.
 At the point where the indifference curve is just tangent to the vertical
 line, consumer 2 could increase her production of software 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and travel further up the vertical line.
 If she travels directly upward, it means that she is holding consumer 1's
 holdings of money constant.
 In other words, if she increases production, she pays all the costs herself.
 At the tangency, she doesn't want to do this - the marginal benefit she
 gets from increasing production is exactly equal to the marginal cost.
 Formally
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial u_{2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-f^{-1}\left(y^{\ast}\right)-x_{1}^{\ast},y^{\ast}\right)}{\partial x}\frac{1}{f^{\prime}\left(y^{\ast}\right)}=\frac{\partial u_{2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-f^{-1}\left(y^{\ast}\right)-x_{1}^{\ast},y^{\ast}\right)}{\partial y}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then if you travel up the vertical line a bit above 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1}^{\ast},y^{\ast}\right)$
\end_inset

, then consumer 2 is strictly worse off.
 How to restore her payoff? You have to give her more money, which means
 reducing the amount of money you leave for consumer 1.
 That means that you have to travel left of the vertical line to restore
 2's payoff.
 The indifference curve must lie to the left of the vertical line at every
 point except at the tangency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig5.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1}^{\ast},y^{\ast}\right)$
\end_inset

 is supposed to coincide with the Nash equilibrium in the voluntary contribution
 game, consumer 1's indifference curve has the same slope as the production
 possibilities frontier at the point where 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 is produced.
 In other words, it is downward sloping, not vertical.
 The lens between the curves represents a situation in which both consumers
 could be made better off - same thing we showed above.

Theoretically, in an open source software world, too little software will

Patents

\begin_layout Standard
In real life, the fact that an outcome isn't pareto optimal doesn't necessarily
 make it bad.
 As I mentioned above, the software products you probably use the most,
 Google search, Facebook and Twitter all use opensource software and give
 back a bunch of the code they write.
 The programming languages which drive most web pages, php, python, and
 javascript, are all open source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to good old fashioned economic theory, the fact that the equilibrium
 of the voluntary contribution game is not pareto optimal makes it sound
 like this is a problem and that SOMETHING MUST BE DONE! Big corporations
 have lots of talented people working for them and this gave them an idea.
 Patents are 'something' therefore WE MUST HAVE PATENTS.

You can read about US copyright and patent laws in a lovely (free) book
 called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Against Intellectual Monopoly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by David Levine and Michele Boldrin (http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual
/againstfinal.htm).
 The book is full of historical anecdotes and simple economic models to
 explain what is going on.
 The gist of their argument is that copyright and patent laws in the US
 are designed to give corporations levers that they can use to prevent entry
 and suppress competition.
 Evidence that these laws encourage creation of public goods is basically
 non-existent, what evidence there is suggests the opposite.
 This is important for Canada since the US almost always insists that countries
 adopt US copyright and patent law before they will engage in trade negotiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way patents work is that one of the two consumers applies for a patent,
 and is then given a monopoly over production of the patented product, in
 this case our software.
 As I mentioned above, the US (and now Canada) has what is called a 'First
 to Patent' law, which means that whoever files a patent on something first
 gets the patent whether they developed the idea or not.
 This creates its own problems.
 For example, patents are sometimes granted after methods are being widely
 used - one click shopping, and dynamic pricing being examples.
 Lets ignore this, and just suppose consumer 2 wins this race.
 Consumer 2 now owns the public good, and can charge whatever price she
 likes for it.
 Suppose she sets the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for the public good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normally we do all our stuff using the price of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and letting the price of good 1 be normalized to 1.
 We'll switch that here, but this shouldn't create too much of a problem.
 The public good 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 has a price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 , while the private good has price 1.
 Given the price set by consumer 2, consumer 1 now finds the best bundle
 of public and private goods he can afford.
 This is given by the point where his indifference curve is tangent to the
 budget line that passes through the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega_{1},0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Why care? The reason is that consumer 1 will no longer be able to produce
 the public good on his own (of if he does, he will have to pay consumer
 2 a fee because she owns the public good).
 So the price that consumer 2 sets will change consumer 1's desire to have
 the public good.
 If consumer 2 sets a price too high, consumer 1 won't want any.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this means is that the patent doesn't by itself give consumer 2 any
 incentive to produce more of the public good - production depends on price,
 which is chosen by consumer 2.
 What the patent does give her is a device that she can use to extract money
 from consumer 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below depicts what consumer 1 would want for three different
 prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig6.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The steepest budget line is the one that has the lowest price for the public
 good, the flattest budget line has the highest price.
 Since 2 now has the 'intellectual' monopoly, she can set any price that
 she likes.
 She will pick the price that maximizes her payoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would seem quite daunting to find this price, since the change in price
 will change consumer 1's consumption of the public good, which will in
 turn effect how much consumer 2 needs to produce.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately we have just the graphic device we need figure out what consumer
 2 will do, since we just figured out what her indifference curves looked
 like in the space depicting consumer 1's consumption of the private and
 public good.
 She will pick the price that put her on the highest indifference curve
 consistent with consumer 1 maximizing subject to his budget constraint.
 You'll notice in the curve above that there is a smooth line that connects
 all the tangency points for different prices.
 This curve is sometimes referred to as the offer curve.
 The picture that follows shows what happens when consumer 2 chooses the
 point on this offer curve that is tangent to her own indifference curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig7.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indifference curve for consumer 2 is now tangent to consumer 1's offer
 curve so consumer 2 is getting the best payoff she can get.
 Consumer 1 is getting the best payoff he can afford.
 Notice that because of the way the offer curve is drawn the two consumers
 indifference curves won't be tangent.
 Both consumers would be better off if more of the public good were produced.
 So the patent solution just produces another inefficient outcome.
 This is why proponents of patents will never talk about how well patents
 work.
 Instead they focus on how bad the outcome is likely to be without them
 - we went over that - not really so bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can continue with graphic reasoning a bit more, but then we'll need to
 switch to algebra.
 The following figure reproduces the outcome for consumer 1 in the equilibrium
 of the voluntary contribution game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig9.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the budget line for consumer 1 with patents starts at his or
 her endowment point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,\omega_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If consumer 2 sets a price for software which allows consumer 1 to buy
 the outcome he enjoyed in the volunary contribution game, then the budget
 line consumer 1 faces would be given by the red line in the picture.
 Since this budget line always lies below the production possibilities curve
 that consumer 1 faces in the volutary contribution game, it will be steeper
 than consumer 1's indifference curve at his allocation in the equilibrium
 of that game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, this is completely working.
 If the price of the software were set so that consumer 1 could reproduce
 the outcome in the volunary contribution game, then consumer 1 would be
 able to purchase the additional software that he wants from consumer 2.
 Consumer 2 would in turn be willing to produce it because she is making
 more than enough money to compensate her for her additional cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What patents get wrong is what they do next - they give consumer 2 control
 over price.
 Most economics students understand at some level that markets don't work
 when some market participant can control the price.
 In this example, it is easy to see why this is the case.
 The patent holder now has a new device for earning money that has nothing
 at all to do with having to produce software.
 It would first occur to her than since she controls price, she can actually
 get the same level of the public good 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 as in the voluntary contribution game, while ending up with a lot more
 money for herself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our formalism, we can use consumer 1's offer curve to understand this.
 Since the budget line that consumer 1 faces when the price is set in such
 a way that he can choose the equilibrium outcome in the voluntary contribution
 game is steeper than his indifference curve at that point, it means that
 consumer 1's offer curve cuts the horizontal line through 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 at a point to the left of consumer 1's original equilibrium allocation.
 The offer curve should look like the solid blue line in the figure above.
 So consumer 2 can raise the price of software until the budget line faced
 by consumer 1 looks like the green line in the next figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename public_goods_fig10.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you recall that the definition of the offer curve is all the points at
 which consumer 1's indifference curve is tangent to a line that runs from
 that point back to the endowment point, consumer 1 will voluntarily choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 units of software when the price is set to the green line is the budget
 line.
 By allowing consumer to control of the price, the patent basically creates
 a subsidy to the patent holder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer 2 might not be satisfied with this subsidy.
 She has really embarked at this point on a new venture - surplus extraction.
 Software is somewhat secondary at this point and she receives her reward
 by manipulating price.
 It is theoretically possible that she might want to raise output of software,
 but as in the figures above, this isn't her main objective, it is to find
 the place where her indifference curve is tangent to consumer 1's indifference
 curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether she does or not can be determined by travelling along the dashed
 horizontal line to the left of the equilibrium point in the voluntary contribut
ion game until you reach the offer curve, given by the solid blue line in
 the figure above.
 Since consumer 2 can achieve any point on the offer curve that she wants,
 what she does will depend on what her indifference curve looks like through
 that point.
 Generally, the tangency with the offer curve may involve either more or
 less software than in the voluntary contribution game.
 So patents are as likely from a theoretical perspective to lower output
 of software as they are to raise it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether software patents work well or not is not a theoretical issue - it
 all depends on preferences and costs.
 You might think that this means that theory has nothing to say about whether
 patents are good or bad.
 Yet the message of the theory is unambigous - having a blanket policy where
 everything is patented (or otherwise protected as 'intellectual property')
 is going to do a lot of harm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can illustrate this with a couple of familiar examples.
 We'll start with one where patents act exclusively as a tax who proceeds
 are transferred to the patent holder, then follow up with an example in
 which patents can be beneficial to everyone (but more often than not just
 act as a way of tranferring income to patent holders).
 In each case we'll follow the assumptions above, but assume that each consumer
 has money income 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 to begin.
 We'll also assume that each unit of software can be produced for one unit
 of income.
 You should work out for yourself what implications those assumptions have
 for the diagrams above.
 All we'll change in the following two examples are consumer preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Quasi-linear preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that consumer preferences are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(x,y\right)=x+\ln\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

, where as above 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is money income, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is software.
 In words preferences are quasi-linear in income, a very common assumption
 in economics.
 In the voluntary contribution game, each consumer's best reply is determined
 by maximizing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x+\ln\left(2\omega-x-x_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the amount of money the other player retains for herself.
 The solution is given by solving
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\frac{1}{2\omega-x-x_{2}},
\]

\end_inset

 so in the symmetric equilibrium of the voluntary contribution game
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\omega-\frac{1}{2}.
\]

\end_inset

This gives output of software in the voluntary contribution game as 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If consumer 2 is given a patent and sets the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for software, consumer 1 will maximize
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega-py+\ln\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

 which, as you know, has solution 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{1}{p}$
\end_inset

.
 We can write consumer 2's payoff for any price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega-\frac{1}{p}+1+\ln\left(\frac{1}{p}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Consumer 2 starts with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, but has to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{p}$
\end_inset

 units of software as requested by consumer 1.
 This costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{p}$
\end_inset

.
 She then receives 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 times 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{p}$
\end_inset

 dollars of revenue from consumer 1, which gives her 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega-\frac{1}{p}+1$
\end_inset

 dollars for herself, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{p}$
\end_inset

 units of software.
 It is straightforward that consumer 2 will choose the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

, so that the same amount of software is produced with patents as is produced
 in the voluntary contribution game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What changes in the solution with patents is the distribution of income.
 Consumer 2 ends up with payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega+\ln\left(1\right)=\omega$
\end_inset

 while consumer 1 ends up with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega-1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the patent simply allows player 2 to charge player 1 for
 all the software, whereas in the voluntary contribution game they would
 have split the cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cobb-Douglas preferences 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things work a bit better for patents when consumers have Cobb-Douglas preference
s.
 Under the right conditions, they can actually benefit both consumers, though,
 for the most part, their main role is still as a redistribution device.
 When preferences are Cobb-Douglas we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u\left(x,y\right)=x^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}.
\]

\end_inset

Consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 maximizes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{\alpha}\left(2\omega-x-x_{2}\right)^{1-\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the amount of income consumer 1 expects consumer 2 to retain for herself
 (which makes her contribution to the production of software 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega-x_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is done subject to the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\le\omega$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first order condition gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\alpha\left(2\omega-x_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which has a solution between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 provided 
\begin_inset Formula $2\alpha$
\end_inset

 is less than 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}<\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The symmetric equilibrium for the voluntary contribution game is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{2\alpha}{1+\alpha}\omega
\]

\end_inset

 for each of the two players.
 The total output of software would then be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
2\omega-\frac{4\alpha}{1+\alpha}\omega=2\omega\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)}{1+\alpha}.\label{voluntary-y}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if 2 has the patent, then as you know, consumer 1 will
 keep the fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of his money income and choose to buy 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}$
\end_inset

 units of the public good.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{1+\alpha}\alpha\omega$
\end_inset

 is obviously strictly larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\omega$
\end_inset

 you can see that consumer 1 will have a lot less income with patents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when 2 charges 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for the public good, her payoff is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)-\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right)^{\left(1-\alpha\right)}.
\]

\end_inset

To figure out whether 1 will end up with more of the public good, we have
 to figure out what price 2 will choose.
 The price that maximizes the expression above will also maximize
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha\ln\left(\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)-\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right)+\left(1-\alpha\right)\ln\left(\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which is a little simpler.
 Differentiate it to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\alpha}{\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)-\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}}\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p^{2}}-\frac{1-\alpha}{p}.
\]

\end_inset

This means that the price 2 will set satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha\omega=p\left(\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)-\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right).
\]

\end_inset

This has solution.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=\frac{1}{2-\alpha}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can compare the two outcomes.
 Since consumer 1 determines the output of software, the total amount of
 software produced with be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}=
\]

\end_inset

Now lets use the diagram above to figure out whether 2 will want more of
 less software than is created in the voluntary contribution game.
 We can decompose her price adjustment into two parts.
 The first thing we could imagine is that she takes the subsidy and raises
 the price to the point where 1 will want the same level of the public good
 as he did in the equilibrium of the voluntary contribution game.
 With Cobb-Douglas preferences, the consumer will always want to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\omega$
\end_inset

 of his income.
 So we want to find a price that make consumer 1 purchase the level of output
 in the voluntary contribution game.
 From (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "voluntary-y"

\end_inset

) this is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\omega\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)}{1+\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 So we want a price such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2\omega\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)}{1+\alpha}=\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=\frac{1+\alpha}{2}.
\]

\end_inset

It isn't too hard to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1+\alpha}{2}>\frac{1}{2-\alpha}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\alpha<1$
\end_inset

, so consumer 2 will set a lower price for software than the price that
 would have supported the same output of software as in the voluntary contributi
on game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could have figured this out more directly.
 Once consumer 2 gets a patent, she automatically receives a transfer of
 income from consumer 1.
 However, the size of the transfer doesn't change as 2 varies the price
 because of the properties of Cobb Douglas preferences.
 So if consumer 1 has Cobb Douglas preferences, the only way consumer 2
 can increase her payoff is by using the transfer to pay for more software
 for herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, if the consumer has more reasonable preferences for which
 the proportion of income that she spends on software rises as software
 prices rise, then consumer 2 will be able to extract even more income from
 consumer 1 by raising software prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that consumer 2 produces more software looks good, but it doesn't
 mean that consumer 1 is any better off than she would have been without
 the patent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If consumer 2 has the patent, then consumer 1 has payoff
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\alpha\omega\right)^{\alpha}\left(\omega\left(1-\alpha\right)\left(2-\alpha\right)\right)^{1-\alpha}=
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)\left(\frac{1}{2-\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\left(1-\alpha\right)}\right)^{\alpha}\left(1-\alpha\right).
\]

\end_inset

In the voluntary contribution game, consumer 1 has payoff 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{2\alpha\omega}{1+\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}\left(2\omega\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha}\right)^{1-\alpha}=
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{2}{1+\alpha}\omega\left(\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}\left(1-\alpha\right)
\]

\end_inset

To compare the payoffs, we need to compare 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\left(2-\alpha\right)\left(\frac{1}{2-\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{1+\alpha}\omega$
\end_inset

.
 We can really figure this out analytically, so we'll turn to the computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next picture shows a plot of the payoffs of consumer 1 as they vary
 with his propensity for keeping is own income, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=2$
\end_inset

.
 This calculation, and the draft are drawn using wxMaxima, which is a free
 computer algebra program.
 If you want to try it for yourself, I left the code for the calculation
 at the top of the diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall, that with CD preferences, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the weight that the consumer gives to retained income 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 - if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is small, the consumer desperately wants software and is willing to pay
 a lot for it.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is large, the consumer isn't so interested in software.
 This is consistent with the 
\emph on
demand 
\emph default
for software 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1-\alpha}{p}$
\end_inset

 - at any price, the consumer will buy less software the larger is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The red curve in the figure below represents the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{1+\alpha}\omega$
\end_inset

 which is the factor associated with the equilibrium of the voluntary contributi
on game.
 The blue figure represents the value of the factor associated with patents.
 The implication of the fact that the red curve lies above the blue curve
 is that consumer 1 is never better off than he was in the equilibrium of
 the voluntary contribution game.
 He gets more software, but the price of the software is much more expensive
 to him than the software he would have produced on his own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\alpha\omega\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{p}\right)=\left(\alpha\omega\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{2\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega}{1+\alpha}\right)^{\left(1-\alpha\right)}
